# 🖼️ DeepDoodle: AI-Powered Comic Generator

DeepDoodle is an Agentic AI framework that transforms natural language stories into illustrated, style-consistent comic panels. 

---
## 📜 Abstract:
In today’s visually driven digital culture, many rich narratives ranging from ancient folk tales to personal memories and imaginative ideas often remain confined to text, limiting their reach and experiential impact. Enabling users to visualize these stories as immersive visual narratives can inspire creativity, preserve cultural heritage, and engage younger, media savvy audiences. We introduce an agentic AI framework that transforms such rich texts into fully illustrated, style-consistent comic panels, enabling end-to-end visual storytelling from natural language. The system accepts user-provided inputs including the story, genre, artistic style, and desired panel count. In the absence of any of these, dedicated agents automatically infer the narrative mood, assign thematic tags, suggest a visual style, and segment the story into coherent scenes. The architecture is composed of modular agents orchestrated using LangChain responsible for metadata extraction, narrative decomposition, prompt engineering, and image generation. Leveraging LLMs, Stable Diffusion XL, the system generates and stylizes story panels based on detailed visual prompts. These panels are composed with consistency in character identity and setting maintained throughout the narrative. Designed with modularity and extensibility in mind, the framework supports multilingual storytelling, artistic style adaptation, and scalable deployment. Potential applications span digital storytelling, education, visual media, and cultural preservation.

## ▶️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/DeepDoodle.git
cd DeepDoodle
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Add environment variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with this content:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN=your_hf_token
```

### 5. (Optional) Place sample images
Put some sample images `sample-panel-<i>.png` in the `output/panels/` folder if you want to test parts of the UI or pipeline with static images.

### 6. Run the Streamlit app
```bash
streamlit run ui/streamlit_app.py
```

## 🧠 Features

- **Story Analyst**: Analyzes the story, extracts genre, style, and mood.
- **Scene Decomposer**: Splits the story into visual scenes/panels.
- **Prompt Engineer**: Converts scenes and metadata into image prompts.
- **Image Generator**: Generates images for each panel based on prompts.
- **Panel Sizer**: Calculates target dimensions for each panel based on the chosen layout and page size, then crops/resizes the raw panel images accordingly.
- **Captioner**: Adds dialogue or narrative captions to the (already sized) panel images.
- **Page Composer**: Arranges the sized and captioned panels onto a blank page according to the selected layout style.
- **LangGraph-based orchestration**: Orchestrates agent communication and workflow.

## 📌 Notes
- Requires valid OpenAI and HuggingFace API keys for full functionality.
- All generated images and pages are saved in the `output/` directory.
- The UI is built with Streamlit for easy interaction.

## ✅ To-Do / Future Enhancements
- Add support for more panel layouts and custom user layouts.
- Integrate real image generation models (DALL-E, SDXL, etc.).
- Improve character consistency and memory.
- Add multi-language support.
- Enhance error handling and logging.
- Add automated tests and CI/CD.
