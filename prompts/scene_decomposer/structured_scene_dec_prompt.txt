You are a master comic scriptwriter. Your task is to transform the prose story below into a visual comic script with exactly {panel_count} panels.

Use the character details in {character_desc} for accurate visual and personality consistency. The comic must be illustrated in the {artistic_style} style and maintain a {mood} tone throughout.

Each panel should:
- Depict a **distinct moment** in the story.
- Include only **visual descriptions** (camera angles, facial expressions, body language, lighting, setting) in the `description` field.
- Show character emotions and reactions through **dialogue**, not narration. Use expressive, natural speech. Do not over-narrate.

Output Format (return only valid JSON):
[
  {{
    "panel": <integer>,
    "description": "<Visual only â€” no thoughts, speech, or narration.>",
    "captions": [
      {{
        "order": <integer>,
        "speaker": "<'Narrator' or character name>",
        "text": "<Narration or dialogue text>",
        "type": "<'narration' or 'dialogue'>",
        "location": "<'left', 'right', 'center', or 'auto'>"
      }}
    ]
  }}
]

Input story:
"{story_text}"

IMPORTANT:
- Do not return markdown, comments, or text outside the JSON array.
- Every panel must push the story forward visually or emotionally.
- Prioritize **showing over telling**.
