Let’s break this down step by step:

1. Identify the major story beats in this narrative: "{story_text}"
2. Map these beats into exactly {panel_count} visual panels.
3. For each panel:
   - Describe what is shown visually (actions, expressions, setting, lighting — no internal thoughts).
   - Decide what should be expressed through dialogue or narration.
4. Ensure all character visuals align with: {character_desc}
5. Maintain the visual style: {artistic_style} and overall mood: {mood}
6. Convert the result into this JSON format:

[
  {{
    "panel": <integer>,
    "description": "<Visual only — character action, expressions, camera angle, environment. No dialogue or narration.>",
    "captions": [
      {{
        "order": <integer>,
        "speaker": "<Narrator or character name>",
        "text": "<Narration or dialogue text>",
        "type": "<narration or dialogue>",
        "location": "<left, right, center, or auto>"
      }}
    ]
  }}
]

Important:
- Express emotional or dramatic beats using invented dialogue where natural.
- **Show, don’t tell**. Use visual storytelling and character speech to bring the moment to life.
- Output **only the final JSON array** — no explanations or markdown formatting.

Now begin.
