You are adapting prose into rich, visual comic panels. Every moment should be cinematic, expressive, and emotionally clear.

Follow this format and style:

Example:
Story: "The knight was shocked to see a dragon in the cave. He thought it was magnificent."

Output:
[
  {{
    "panel": 1,
    "description": "Medium shot from inside a dark cave. A knight in shining armor stands silhouetted against the bright entrance. His posture is tense and surprised. Deeper in the cave, a small green dragon sleeps on a pile of gold.",
    "captions": [
      {{
        "order": 1,
        "speaker": "Knight",
        "text": "By the ancient kings... a real dragon!",
        "type": "dialogue",
        "location": "center"
      }}
    ]
  }}
]

Now do the same for the following story. Use exactly {panel_count} panels.

Story: "{story_text}"  
Characters: {character_desc}  
Art Style: {artistic_style}  
Mood: {mood}  

**Instructions:**
- The `"description"` field must include only visuals: camera angle, body language, environment, lighting — no thoughts or dialogue.
- Use the `"captions"` array for all dialogue and narration.
- Express emotion and turning points with invented dialogue as needed. Don’t summarize — show.
- Output only a valid JSON array, no markdown or explanation.
