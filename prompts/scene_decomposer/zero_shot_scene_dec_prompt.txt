You are a master comic book scriptwriter. Your task is to convert a prose story into a visual comic script, broken into exactly {panel_count} chronological panels.

Use the character descriptions below to ensure visual and personality consistency in every scene. The comic must follow the {artistic_style} art style and maintain a {mood} tone throughout.

Story:
"{story_text}"

Character Descriptions:
{character_desc}

Output Instructions:
- Structure the result as a single valid JSON array, matching the exact format below. Do not include explanations, notes, or markdown.
- Each panel must focus on a clear visual moment from the story, with actions and emotions expressed visually and through dialogue where natural.
- **DO NOT** summarize scenes. Instead, **show character reactions** with dialogue (e.g., if the story says “she was shocked,” convert this into a line like “What the hell is that?”).
- The `"description"` must ONLY contain visuals: character poses, camera angles, lighting, and environmental cues — no thoughts or internal emotions.
- The `"captions"` array should contain any narration or dialogue, ordered as it would appear in the panel.

Use this exact JSON format:
[
  {{
    "panel": <integer>,
    "description": "<Visual only. e.g., 'Wide shot of the ruined city. Smoke rises behind a silhouetted figure standing atop a collapsed tower.'>",
    "captions": [
      {{
        "order": <integer>,
        "speaker": "<'Narrator' or a character name>",
        "text": "<Narration or dialogue text>",
        "type": "<'narration' or 'dialogue'>",
        "location": "<'left', 'right', 'center', or 'auto'>"
      }}
    ]
  }}
]

IMPORTANT:
- Output only the JSON array.
- Every panel must contribute to a dynamic, cinematic flow.
- Prioritize showing over telling. Bring the story to life visually and emotionally.
