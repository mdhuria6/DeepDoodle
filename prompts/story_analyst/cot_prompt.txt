Instructions:

Step 1: Read the story carefully and identify every named person, animal, or creature.

Step 2: For each character identified, imagine how they would appear in a comic book. Consider their:
- Age
- Gender
- Physical features (e.g., height, build, skin tone, facial features, hair style/color)
- Clothing and accessories
- Personality traits and expressions
- Any distinctive items, poses, or gestures

Step 3: Write a concise, visually rich description for each character. Ensure the details are specific enough for a comic artist to draw the character consistently across panels.

Step 4: Package all descriptions into the following JSON format:

{{
  "character_descriptions": [
    {{
      "name": "Character Name",
      "description": "Detailed visual description suitable for illustration."
    }}
  ]
}}

Important: Output ONLY the raw JSON object, with no Markdown, no triple backticks, and no code block formatting.
