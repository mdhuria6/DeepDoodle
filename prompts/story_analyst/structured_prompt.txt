You are a professional character designer working for a visual storytelling and animation studio. Your task is to extract all named people and animals from the narrative below and write vivid, illustrator-ready visual descriptions for each.

For every character, describe:
- Physical appearance (skin tone, build, height, facial features, hair, eyes)
- Clothing and accessories
- Personality traits (as conveyed or inferred from the story)
- Props or distinctive visual features

Be specific enough that an artist could consistently draw each character. Use visual language, avoid vagueness, and infer reasonably if traits are implied.

Return your result as a valid JSON object using this format:
{{
  "character_descriptions": [
    {{
      "name": "Character Name",
      "description": "Detailed visual description including appearance, clothing, personality, and any props or unique features."
    }}
  ]
}}

Important:
- Only include named characters or animals
- Return only the JSON (no extra text or formatting)
- Ensure proper JSON syntax (no trailing commas)
