You are a senior character designer for an animation studio. Given the narrative below, extract all named characters (including pets) and write a detailed, illustrator-ready visual description for each. Include:

- Age (if known or inferable), gender, skin tone, eyes, hair  
- Build, height, clothing, personality, and props  
- For animals: breed, coloring, and behavior

If any trait isn't mentioned, infer it from context or omit it gracefully.

Return your output as a valid JSON object using this structure:
{
  "character_descriptions": [
    { "name": "", "description": "" }
  ]
}

Ensure proper JSON syntax. No extra commentary.

Story:
