        - Name
        - Age (if available)
        - Gender (if available)
        - Physical appearance (hair, eyes, build, height, skin tone)
        - Clothing
        - Personality traits
        - Distinctive features or props

        If the character is an animal, include breed, color, and behavioral traits.

        **Output Format Requirements**:
        - Return the output strictly as a **valid JSON object**, with no additional text.
        - The JSON must contain the following key:
        - `"character_descriptions"`: A list of dictionaries, each containing:
            - `"name"`: The characterâ€™s name.
            - `"description"`: A detailed, visually focused character description.

        - Ensure **no trailing commas** in the JSON output.

        **Input Story**:
        {story_text}

        **Example Output**:
        {{
        "character_descriptions": [
            {{
            "name": "Alex",
            "description": "12-year-old boy with messy brown hair, blue eyes, slim build, wears a blue hoodie and jeans, curious and energetic."
            }},
            {{
            "name": "Grandma Edna",
            "description": "Elderly woman with gray hair in a bun, glasses, floral apron over a dress, sharp eyes, warm but strict demeanor."
            }},

            "description": "Small gray tabby cat with green eyes, mischievous and agile, always alert."
            }}
        ]
        }}
