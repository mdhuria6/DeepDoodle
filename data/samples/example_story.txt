In the silent hum of the deep space observatory, veteran astronomer Elara felt a familiar loneliness. 
    For years, her screens showed nothing but cosmic static. 
    Tonight was different. A single, pure sine wave, glowing an emerald green, cut through the noise. 
    It was a signal. Before she could process it, alarms blared. 
    A nearby red giant, catalogued for centuries, had gone supernova, decades ahead of schedule. 
    The energy readings were impossible. As the shockwave data streamed in, she saw it: the supernova's energy was being shaped, focused. 
    The sine wave wasn't from the star; it was riding the wave, a message in a bottle on a stellar tsunami. 
    It was an invitation. Years later, her hair now streaked with grey, Elara steps out onto a world bathed in the light of twin suns. 
    The air is sweet, the ground soft. A bustling, elegant city rises in the distance, a testament to her arrival. 
    She looks at a device in her hand, which displays that same, beautiful green sine wave. 
    She wasn't the discoverer of a message; she was its recipient. 
    And she was finally home.
