# Scene Decomposer Agent - Thesis Report

## Agent Description

The Scene Decomposer agent is a critical narrative transformation component in the DeepDoodle automated comic generation system. It serves as the bridge between analyzed story elements and visual panel creation, transforming linear narrative text into structured visual scenes with dialogue, narration, and visual descriptions. The agent employs advanced Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities combined with robust validation mechanisms to ensure reliable scene generation.

**Core Functionality:**
- Decomposes narrative text into precisely specified number of visual scenes
- Generates appropriate dialogue and narration for each scene
- Creates detailed visual descriptions for artists/image generators
- Maintains character consistency across panels using character descriptions
- Applies artistic style and mood guidelines to scene creation
- Provides comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms

## Role

The Scene Decomposer acts as the **narrative-to-visual translator** and **screenplay creator** in the comic generation pipeline. Its primary responsibilities include:

1. **Story Segmentation**: Breaking down linear narrative into discrete visual scenes
2. **Visual Description Generation**: Creating detailed artistic descriptions for each panel
3. **Dialogue Creation**: Inferring and generating appropriate character dialogue
4. **Narrative Flow Management**: Ensuring chronological and logical scene progression
5. **Character Consistency**: Maintaining character behavior and appearance across scenes
6. **Format Standardization**: Converting scenes into structured JSON format for downstream processing

**Position in Pipeline**: Story Analyst → **Scene Decomposer** → Layout Planner → Prompt Engineer → Image Generator → Panel Sizer → Captioner → Page Composer

## Problem Solved: Existing Problem

**Traditional Manual Process Problems:**

1. **Manual Scene Breakdown**: Human scriptwriters must manually segment stories into visual scenes, which is time-intensive and subjective
2. **Dialogue Inference**: Converting prose into comic dialogue requires creative interpretation and understanding of visual storytelling
3. **Visual Description Creation**: Translating narrative descriptions into specific visual instructions for artists
4. **Consistency Management**: Maintaining character appearance and behavior consistency across multiple panels
5. **Panel Count Constraints**: Adapting stories to fit specific panel limitations while preserving narrative flow
6. **Format Standardization**: Converting creative vision into structured, machine-readable formats

**Specific Technical Problems Addressed:**

- **Prose-to-Scene Translation**: Converting continuous narrative text into discrete visual moments
- **Visual Storytelling Adaptation**: Applying "show, don't tell" principles to prose narratives
- **Character Voice Generation**: Creating authentic dialogue that matches character personalities
- **Scene Pacing**: Distributing narrative content appropriately across specified panel counts
- **Metadata Integration**: Incorporating artistic style, mood, and character descriptions into scene creation
- **Output Validation**: Ensuring generated scenes meet structural and quantity requirements

**Business Impact:**
- Reduces scriptwriting time from hours to minutes
- Ensures consistent visual storytelling approach
- Enables automatic adaptation of stories to different panel counts
- Supports non-scriptwriters in comic creation
- Provides standardized output for automated image generation

## Challenges Faced During Implementation

### 1. LLM Output Validation and Consistency
**Challenge**: LLMs often generate incorrect panel counts or malformed JSON structures
**Solution**: 
- Implemented comprehensive validation logic with retry mechanisms
- Added specific panel count verification with truncation/padding strategies
- Created robust JSON parsing with sanitization functions

```python
if len(scenes) != panel_count:
    if attempt < max_retries - 1:
        logger.warning(f"Expected {panel_count} panels, got {len(scenes)}. Retrying...")
        continue
    else:
        if len(scenes) < panel_count:
            raise RuntimeError(f"Failed to generate enough scenes after {max_retries} attempts.")
        else:
            scenes = scenes[:panel_count]  # Truncate excess scenes
```

### 2. Dialogue Generation vs. Narration Balance
**Challenge**: LLMs tend to convert everything to narration rather than creating engaging dialogue
**Solution**: 
- Developed specific prompt engineering strategies emphasizing dialogue creation
- Added explicit rules for character voice and speech pattern inference
- Implemented "show, don't tell" principles in prompt design

```plaintext
Critical Rules:
1. Generate Dialogue: If a character has a realization, expresses an emotion, or takes a significant action, you should invent a short, impactful line of dialogue for them.
```

### 3. Visual Description Clarity
**Challenge**: Ensuring visual descriptions contain only artistic direction without dialogue or narrative elements
**Solution**: 
- Created strict separation between visual descriptions and caption content
- Implemented clear schema requirements with mandatory field validation
- Added specific examples of proper visual vs. narrative content

### 4. Character Consistency Integration
**Challenge**: Maintaining character visual consistency across multiple scenes using external character descriptions
**Solution**: 
- Developed character description string formatting for LLM consumption
- Integrated character metadata directly into scene generation prompts
- Added validation for character description format compatibility

```python
if isinstance(character_descriptions, list) and character_descriptions:
    char_desc_str = "\n".join(
        f'- "{c["name"]}": "{c["description"]}"' for c in character_descriptions 
        if c.get('name') and c.get('description')
    )
```

### 5. Multi-Attempt Error Recovery
**Challenge**: Balancing retry attempts with system performance and reliability
**Solution**: 
- Implemented configurable retry mechanisms with progressive fallbacks
- Added detailed logging for debugging failed attempts
- Created graceful degradation strategies for partial success scenarios

```python
for attempt in range(max_retries):
    try:
        response = llm.generate_text(prompt, max_tokens=8000)
        # Process and validate response
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Attempt {attempt + 1} failed: {e}")
        continue
```

## Output: Response

The Scene Decomposer returns a structured dictionary containing validated scene data:

```python
{
    "scenes": [
        {
            "panel": 1,
            "description": "Close-up on Elara's wide, shocked eyes, illuminated by the green glow of the monitor. Her face shows a mix of fear and fascination.",
            "captions": [
                {
                    "order": 1,
                    "speaker": "Elara",
                    "text": "This can't be real...",
                    "type": "dialogue",
                    "location": "center"
                },
                {
                    "order": 2,
                    "speaker": "Narrator",
                    "text": "The forbidden data streams across her screen.",
                    "type": "narration",
                    "location": "auto"
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "current_panel_index": 0
}
```
