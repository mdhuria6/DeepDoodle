He steals socks, gives life advice, and organizes books by mood. When a group of scientists tried to capture him, he turned them into moths and sent them to Saturn. The Moon just sighed, kissed his head, and told him to behave. He never does."

        "expanded_story": "In the closing years of WWII, a daring Nazi operation is devised: to kidnap Prime Minister Winston Churchill during a planned visit to a quiet English village. Colonel Radl crafts the plan and assigns command to paratrooper Kurt Steiner, whose men disguise themselves as Polish troops. Joanna Grey, a Nazi sympathizer living in England, and Liam Devlin, an Irish poet turned saboteur, assist in the mission. Though the plan is meticulous, unexpected encounters and British resistance unravel their cover. What follows is a deadly standoff as Churchill’s security is tightened. The novel blends action, espionage, and historical fiction, imagining what might have happened if the operation had succeeded. Comic illustrations emphasize foggy moors, covert gear, and split-second betrayals—all under the looming specter of war."

Ahab reveals that his true goal is not profit but vengeance—he seeks to destroy Moby Dick, the legendary white whale that maimed him. As the crew journeys across oceans, their camaraderie and superstitions grow, but so does Ahab’s madness. Harpooners like Queequeg bring spiritual depth, while first mate Starbuck begins to question the morality of their captain's mission. When they finally encounter the great whale, the battle is cataclysmic. One by one, the crew is lost, and Ahab perishes entangled in his obsession. Only Ishmael survives, floating on Queequeg’s coffin, left to bear witness. The novel explores man versus nature, obsession, and fate. A comic adaptation would feature sweeping ocean vistas, storm-wracked decks, and explosive confrontations between harpoon and leviathan."
