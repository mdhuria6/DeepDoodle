He is usually depicted in flashbacks or portraits, wearing a charcoal-colored suit with a high collar and a cravat. His hands are long-fingered and expressive, often shown suspended mid-air at a piano. He always wore round spectacles, which reflect light mysteriously when seen in shadow. In his final scene, his fingers rest gently on the unfinished keys, with sheet music scattered around him like fallen leaves."

Horrified by its monstrous appearance, Victor abandons it. Left alone, the Creature seeks affection but is met only with fear and hatred. As it learns language and emotion, it grows bitter from rejection. After suffering greatly, it confronts Victor and demands a companion. When Victor refuses, the Creature swears vengeance, leading to the deaths of Victor's loved ones. Pursued into the Arctic, both man and monster are ultimately lost to madness and isolation. The story is told through letters from Captain Walton, who encounters Victor in the frozen north. Frankenstein explores creation, responsibility, and the blurred line between man and monster.
