    "expanded_story": "After being summoned to deliver a lecture at the Capitol, symbologist Robert Langdon finds himself thrust into a race against time when his mentor Peter Solomon is kidnapped. The captor, Mal\u2019akh, demands Langdon uncover ancient Masonic secrets buried beneath Washington D.C. Teaming up with Peter\u2019s sister, Katherine, a scientist studying noetic consciousness, Langdon must solve a trail of symbols and codes hidden in national landmarks. As the search deepens, they uncover a hidden chamber, ancient philosophies, and truths meant to uplift humanity. Mal\u2019akh seeks transcendence through chaos, testing the limits of belief and sacrifice. Through puzzles, danger, and philosophical exploration, Langdon must save Peter, protect the knowledge, and confront the possibility that enlightenment lies not in magic\u2014but in the mind. The story blends modern science, ancient wisdom, and high-stakes tension in a uniquely cerebral thriller.",
