In the ruins of New York, she leads a desperate counter-offensive, her team scavenging alien tech to mount guerrilla strikes. Meanwhile, Xel’tor, a Zahrak warlord bred for conquest, begins to study humanity closer. After witnessing Elena save a child amidst the chaos, he starts to feel something foreign—doubt. As resistance and Zahrak forces clash in a decimated Manhattan, Elena and Xel’tor’s paths converge. In a tense stand-off, Elena offers peace through alliance against a more sinister faction of Zahrak intent on planetary extinction. Torn between loyalty and conscience, Xel’tor must decide: obey the empire, or fight beside the very species he came to destroy."
