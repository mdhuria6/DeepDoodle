She wears a corseted coat with lapels lined in cog-shaped embroidery and a waistcoat with a winding key protruding from her left side. A small glass window on her chest reveals the golden ticking heart inside—its motion visible in line art. Her gloves are fingerless, and she carries a retractable monocle connected to a chain. Her boots are high-laced with metal reinforcements. Her demeanor is headstrong and curious, and she’s frequently shown mid-step in cobblestone streets or wrenching open secret doors beneath the city."

                "name": "Queen’s Heir",
                "description": "A slender young royal with androgynous features, shoulder-length blonde hair tied back with a ribbon bearing the Aerwyn crest. He wears a velvet coat adorned with insignia, brass shoulder clasps, and a timepiece brooch over the heart. In captivity, his clothing is tattered but retains royal detail—like polished buttons and patterned cuffs. His wrists bear faint mechanical scars hinting at tampering with ancient tech. He is calm but observant, often depicted chained in silhouette or holding a faded locket with Imogen’s family crest inside. His expressions are subtle—half-smiles, furrowed brows—and carry a mix of vulnerability and quiet defiance."

        "expanded_story": "Lady Imogen Thistlewick was born with a ticking heart. Literally. Her father, a renowned chronomechanic, had replaced her failing organ with a brass timepiece. It chimed at every hour and needed daily winding. In the floating city of Aerwyn, she was both marvel and menace. When the queen’s heir was kidnapped, Imogen was blamed—until clues in the ransom demanded her heart. Realizing her clock-heart powered something greater—an ancient machine buried beneath the city—Imogen unraveled the conspiracy. She had one choice: save the heir or free herself. She chose neither. She rewrote the gears of fate."
