[2025-06-25 02:24:37] Score: 6/10 | Feedback: The generated prompt partially meets the requirements but has notable deficiencies. Structurally, it lacks distinct sections for 'featuring', 'Scene', 'Captions', 'Art Style', and 'Mood', which affects its clarity and organization. The information collation is mostly accurate, with the correct characters and scene description included, but it omits Dr. Hex in the 'featuring' section. The 'Art Style' section effectively uses keywords associated with the 'Modern Comic Style', but the lack of clear sectioning diminishes its impact.
