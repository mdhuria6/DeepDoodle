[2025-06-25 02:52:11] PASS: Image dimensions (256x320) are correct.
[2025-06-25 02:52:18] LLM Judge Evaluation: Score: 7/10 | Feedback: The image captures the essence of the prompt with a character that resembles Elara, featuring grey-streaked hair and a contemplative demeanor. The setting of a deep space observatory is well-depicted with multiple screens and a console. However, the character appears younger than described, lacking visible signs of aging. The style aligns with a comic aesthetic, and the mood is neutral, but the lighting could be more cinematic. The image is technically well-executed with no negative elements present.
