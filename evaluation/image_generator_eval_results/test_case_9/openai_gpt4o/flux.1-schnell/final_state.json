  "story_text": "In the verdant heart of Vrindavan, where the Yamuna river whispered secrets to the wind, a celestial event unfolded. The sky was painted in hues of twilight as the earth prepared to receive a divine child. Born in the prison cell of Mathura, Krishna's arrival was heralded by the celestial beings, for he was destined to restore dharma.\n\nThe tyrant King Kamsa, haunted by a prophecy of his downfall at the hands of his sister's child, sought to vanquish the infant. Yet, the cosmos conspired against him. Under the cover of a stormy night, Vasudeva, Krishna's father, carried the infant across the Yamuna, which parted its waters in reverence. In Gokul, Krishna found solace and love in the arms of Yashoda.\n\nAs Krishna grew, his divine aura became apparent. He charmed the villagers with his playful antics, yet his eyes held the wisdom of ages. But darkness loomed as Kamsa's demons, sent to thwart his destiny, descended upon the land. Krishna, with the strength of a thousand suns, vanquished them, each victory a testament to his divine purpose.\n\nIn the climactic moment, Krishna faced Kamsa in the grand arena. With a serene smile, he toppled the tyrant, fulfilling the prophecy. The land rejoiced, for dharma had been restored. Yet, as the echoes of celebration faded, Krishna gazed into the horizon, knowing his journey was far from over. The world awaited his guidance, and he, the eternal protector, was ready.",
