  "story_text": "The rain drummed a relentless beat against the windows of the old mansion, perched like a forgotten relic on the edge of the island. Detective Sam Marlowe, trench coat soaked and cigarette barely hanging from his lips, stepped into the dimly lit foyer. The air was thick with the scent of damp wood and something else—fear.\n\nTen strangers had been summoned here by cryptic invitations. Now, two were dead. The island, shrouded in mist, offered no escape. Marlowe's eyes narrowed as he scanned the room, taking in the anxious faces gathered around the flickering fireplace. Each one a suspect, each one a potential victim.\n\nThe storm outside mirrored the tension within. As the night wore on, whispers of betrayal and hidden pasts filled the air. Marlowe pieced together the puzzle, each revelation a jagged shard of truth. The killer was among them, playing a deadly game.\n\nA scream shattered the uneasy truce. Marlowe raced to the source, his heart pounding like a war drum. In the library, a figure lay sprawled, lifeless. The others gathered, eyes wide with terror. Marlowe's mind raced, the pieces clicking into place.\n\nWith a sudden clarity, he turned to face the group. \"The killer,\" he said, voice steady, \"is one of us.\" The words hung heavy in the air, a chilling promise of what was yet to come. The storm raged on, an endless night with no dawn in sight.",

One by one, they begin to die, following a sinister nursery rhyme. Tensions rise, suspicions mount, and paranoia consumes them as they realize the killer is among them. In the end, all ten perish. Later, a letter reveals the mastermind was Judge Wargrave, who meticulously planned the justice-themed killings before taking his own life.",
